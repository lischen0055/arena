<h4>HORST Arts &amp; Music</h4>

<p>HORST Arts &amp; Music is a two-day celebration of art and music in a setting like no other. The festival collaborates with an array of talented artists and offers a well-selected worldwide collage of electronic music and in situ visual arts. Nestled away in the green Hageland hills, Belgium you’ll find the 15th century moated castle of Horst. An inspiring space for site-specific art and the perfect festive backdrop.</p>

<h4>Horst: The Festival That Blends Music, Art, and Architecture</h4>

<p>From 2014 to 2018, Horst Arts &amp; Music took place on the idyllic Castle grounds in Holsbeek. It grew into an internationally renowned platform for showcasing cutting-edge electronic music, inventive in-situ art, and architecture. Horst aligned a three-day immersive music festival with longer-term trajectories in which architects were invited to create unique stages and dancefloors, and in which contemporary artists were commissioned to enter into dialogue with their surroundings through site-specific new productions. - arch daily</p>

<h4>Dîner en blanc - mass picnic</h4>

<p>Dîner en blanc or Fête en blanc is a community picnic, which takes place in many different communities around the world. It&#39;s common in big cities as well as in small villages (also in the rural areas around Munich). All the people come together -dressed completely in white- , bring their food and have a shared dinner. This tradition originated in Paris and is a kind of social dining and &quot;mass picnic&quot;.</p>
